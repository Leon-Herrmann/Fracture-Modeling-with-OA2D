# Fracture-Modeling-with-OA2D
The off-axis 2D user element, OA2D from https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/lapm/off-axis-2d-user-element-library-for-abaqus, is applied to the damage mechanisms occurring during tension-tension fatigue in fiber-reinforced composites, i.e. tunneling cracks and delamination.
